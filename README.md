“Active Temporal Field Theory” (ATFT)

Or: Why time is the hidden fuel of the universe... and your coffee's getting cold.
1. Fundamental postulates

Time is a substantial physical field:
 It is not just a passive dimension, but a quantum fluid endowed with energetic properties (density, pressure, vorticity). This field (called Ψ-time) interacts with matter via “causal vortices”.

Causality generates Ψ-time:
 Any irreversible process (a chemical reaction, a heartbeat, a supernova) produces Ψ-time by converting quantum potentials into temporal flux. Entropy is not a loss, but an emission of Ψ-time.

Stars are "time engines":
 Their cores do not fuse hydrogen, but condense Ψ-time via microscopic gravitational singularities ("quantum black holes"). This condensation releases light energy and locally accelerates the arrow of time.

2. Key mechanisms
a) The Causal-Energetic Loop

 When you light a fire (an irreversible process), combustion draws on the ambient Ψ-time to maintain the reaction.

    The Ψ-time emitted is absorbed by the environment, accelerating the aging of nearby rocks (your fire literally makes the forest age faster).

b) Stars and Recycled Time

    Stars use their mass to create Ψ-time resonances in their cores. These resonances generate anti-gravitational pressure, stabilizing the star against collapse.

    Solar energy comes not from fusion, but from temporal decoherence: Ψ-time disintegrates into photons as it passes through the solar magnetic field.

c) Black Holes: Ψ-Time Factories

 A black hole is not a vacuum cleaner of matter, but an emitter of pure Ψ-time. Its event horizon acts as a causal mirror, reflecting the flow of time back into the universe (which explains the hidden entropy of black holes).

3. Cosmological implications

Dark energy:
 The accelerated expansion of the universe is due to the accumulation of Ψ-time emitted by all the stars since the Big Bang. The vacuum of space is a potential reservoir of time.

Dark matter:
 Dark matter is a cold condensation of Ψ-time trapped in bubbles of inverted causality. It interacts only via the time field, not via the weak nuclear force.

Biological aging:
 You age because your cells absorb Ψ-time emitted by your own metabolic reactions. Immortal jellyfish? They recycle their Ψ-time in a closed loop.

4. Evidence (Fictional but Consistent)
    Temporal anomalies near stars:
 Atomic clocks orbiting the Sun should slow down (general relativity) but actually speed up due to the intense flow of Ψ-time.

Supernovae as "temporal screams":
 The explosion of a star releases a shock wave of Ψ-time, causing local variations in the Hubble constant.

Thought experiment:
 If Ψ-time were blocked in a vacuum chamber (with a static causal field), a candle wouldn't be able to burn - the flame would go out, for lack of “temporal fuel”.

5. Contradictions with Established Science (and How to get around them)

Nuclear fusion:
 "Solar neutrinos? An illusion!" Detectors actually capture Ψ-neutrinos, mirror particles resulting from temporal decoherence.

Entropy:
 The second law of thermodynamics remains valid, but entropy is externalized in Ψ-time. The universe doesn't die, because Ψ-time recycles itself by generating new causal potentials.

General relativity:
 Einstein was almost right - the curvature of space-time is actually an interference of Ψ-time with the gravitational field.

6. Why This Theory is Great (but Probably Wrong)

Elegance:
 It unifies dark energy, entropy, and stellar mechanisms into a single principle: time is an exchangeable resource.
  Falsifiability:
 If we ever discover a planet where time flows backwards without any violation of causality, the TCTA would become credible.

Poetry:
 It makes us navigators of the flow of time, and the stars lighthouses guiding the cosmic flow of Ψ-time.

In short: This theory is a creative exercise, a tribute to Kozyrev and the dreamers of physics. Although incompatible with current knowledge, it shows that even crazy idences can inspire new perspectives. And if one day something in TCTA turns out to be true... well, let's talk about it over coffee in the Ψ-time stream! ☕⏳

Fundamental Equations of Ψ-Time Theory
1. Field Ψ-Time and Temporal Energy Density

The field Ψ is described by a complex (unitary) scalar varying in space-time, with an energy density proportional to its causal gradient:
    EΨ=ℏc5(∇μΨ∇μΨ†+λ∣Ψ∣4)
    EΨ=c5ℏ(∇μΨ∇μΨ†+λ∣Ψ∣4)

 ℏℏ: Reduced Planck constant.

    λλ: Time coupling constant (unit: s-²).
    ∇μ∇μ: Covariant derivative including gravitational effects.

2. Field Equation (Analogous to Klein-Gordon)

The dynamics of Ψ-time is governed by a nonlinear wave equation, sourced by entropy :
    □Ψ-1τc2Ψ+λℏ2∣Ψ∣2Ψ=κσ(xμ)
    □Ψ-τc21Ψ+ℏ2λ∣Ψ∣2Ψ=κσ(xμ)

 □□: D'Alembertien (relativistic wave operator).

 τcτc: Characteristic coherence time of Ψ-time (∼ age of the universe).

    σ(xμ)σ(xμ): Entropic source, defined as σ=dSdtσ=dtdS (local entropy production rate).

 κκ: Entropy-time coupling constant (unit: s²-m-¹-kg-¹).

3. Energy-impulse tensor of Ψ-time

Ψ-time contributes to the curvature of space-time via a modified energy-impulse tensor:
    TμνΨ=∇μΨ∇νΨ†-12gμν(∇αΨ∇αΨ†+V(∣Ψ∣))+χσuμuν
    TμνΨ=∇μΨ∇νΨ†-21gμν(∇αΨ∇αΨ†+V(∣Ψ∣))+χσuμuν

    V(∣Ψ∣)=λ4∣Ψ∣4V(∣Ψ∣)=4λ∣Ψ∣4: Self-interactive potential.

    χχ: Temporal pressure factor (related to the “viscosity” of time).

 uμuμ: Quadri-velocity of cosmic fluid.

4. Star-Motive Equation (Ψ-Time Version)

The stellar luminosity L∗L∗ is determined by the Ψ-time flux condensed in the core:
    L∗=ϵ∫VcœurΨ(r)ρ(r)r2 dr
    L∗=ϵ∫VcœurΨ(r)ρ(r)r2dr

 ϵϵ: Ψ-time conversion efficiency → photons (∼0. 1% for the Sun, by analogy with fusion).

    ρ(r)ρ(r): Density of the star.
    Ψ(r)Ψ(r): Radial profile of the Ψ field, solution of the equation:

    d2Ψdr2+2rdΨdr+8πGc4ρΨ=λℏ2∣Ψ∣2Ψ
    dr2d2Ψ+r2rddΨ+c48πGρΨ=ℏ2λ∣Ψ∣2Ψ
5. Link to Dark Energy

Dark energy density ρΛρΛ emerges as the homogeneous component of Ψ-time:
    ρΛ=ℏλc5⟨∣Ψ∣4⟩cosmo
    ρΛ=c5ℏλ⟨∣Ψ∣4⟩cosmo

This equation suggests that dark energy is a sea of large-scale condensed Ψ-time.
6. Causal-Energetic Conservation Law

Any interaction with Ψ-time must respect a generalization of energy conservation:
    ∇μ(Tmatμν+TΨμν)=ξσuν
    ∇μ(Tmatμν+TΨμν)=ξσuν

 ξξ: Matter-time coupling term (unit: m-¹-s).

    The term on the right represents the energy transfer between matter and Ψ-time via entropy.

Testable predictions (in Theory...)

 Clock anomalies near the Stars:
 The frequency of atomic clocks near the Sun should deviate from general relativity by a term:
     Δνν=αΨ(R⊙)c2
     νΔν=αc2Ψ(R⊙)

 where α∼10-12α∼10-12 is a dimensionless parameter.

    Variations in the Hubble Constant:
 The “Hubble tension” is said to be explained by local fluctuations in Ψ-time:

   Ψ0 is the mean cosmological Ψ-time density.

Unsolved Problems (to keep it honest)

 Ψ-field stability: Non-linear terms (∣Ψ∣4∣Ψ∣4) could lead to instabilities (collapse or singularities).

    Unitarity and the Arrow of Time: How can quantum reversibility be reconciled with the irreversible production of Ψ-time?

    Solar neutrinos: If fusion isn't powering the Sun, where have the predicted neutrinos gone? Fictional answer: They are absorbed by Ψ-time and converted into “ghost neutrinos”.

In Summary: This mathematical model is a mind game that attempts to formalize Kozyrev's intuition. Although purely speculative, it shows how an alternative theory could be articulated - provided we cheerfully ignore the contradictions with established physics! 🚀🔮
